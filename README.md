# How works?
The user is asked for a 4-digit number, the first digit will be A, the second will be B, the third C and the fourth D.

The first thing that is done is to add 7 to each amount, and then calculate the remainder of a division by 10.

In addition, the numbers change position, the number A exchanges position with C and the number B exchanges position with D in an arraylist, so that they are later converted to a single final quantity

At the end of the program, 2 variables are delivered, the first indicates the number that the user entered and the second is his encrypted number.
